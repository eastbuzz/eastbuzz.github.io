Through the Project Aura, Google tried to develop a user rapidly embraced by the general public.　　Project Aura, the outside world now don\'t know much. If you can finish the development, so the final product will be with the Oculus Rift and other virtual reality equipment market in the same period. In the corporate market, Project HoloLens Aura may be Microsoft competitor.　　Some Apple fans may be familiar with Tony Fadell, who is the founder of iPod. Hope that under the leadership of Tony Fadell, Google to launch to attract corporate and consumer market product.　　Tony Fadell once said in a media interview, glass failed prematurely due to launch to the public developer version (Explorer Edition). He said glass can become important products like the iPod or iPhone, but to get it back on track, will take some time.　　Fadell, glasses to normal Google launched the beta version of Google gets from user feedback, however, from the point of view of processing hardware and not software, this may not be the best strategy.　　\"If you do services based only on electronic components, you may rapidly repeated, testing, revising, until it just right. But when you\'re dealing with hardware, you have to have a line, and it will take a year or more to develop such a product, so you better know what your product is, what is the function of your product, especially when the product does not have the kind of functions. \"Tony Fadell said.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: gadgets Science and technologyIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
