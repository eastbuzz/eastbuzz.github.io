According to the latest data show that 70% Apple users rarely use Siri, Apple is a little embarrassing. There is no doubt that users do not make use of a service, the most fundamental reason is that it is not good enough, what Siri needs to upgrade it?

In fact, the speech Assistant\'s original intention was to some extent replaced the touch operation, such artificial intelligence (including speech recognition, logical associations, etc) plays a key role here.
