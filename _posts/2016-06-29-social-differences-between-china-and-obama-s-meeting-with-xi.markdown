Both Chinese and foreign business, like using alcohol as a catalyst for improving the atmosphere. However, because of differences in culture, Western table rule that has made all the difference, if you hold the domestic drinking culture, dinners with foreigners gourd painting on gourds, will make a big joke. Due to work on the relationship, the author frequently exposed to public company bosses and customers at home and abroad, also in Chinese and foreign agencies working, so do some comparison between Chinese and Western wine culture here, to share with you.![Alt Social differences between China and Obama\'s meeting with XI](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7300/27358116924_251033d286.jpg)Chinese and Western social how entertaining the President learned muchForeigners drink value prioritiesTable of Chinese culture, must be heroic enough, key in a respectful atmosphere, wine is a relationship tool, you can keep toast from the outset until the end. But for foreigners, wine art, rhythm driven by the wine and food of the dinner, order and the pair are very important.Foreigners drink order very seriously, generally in Champagne, guests can wander chatted with each other. To the official seat of the time, begins with soup, salad and topped with white wine, and then the main course served with red wine. If there are more than a main course will be relatively light on entrees, served with wine (the Body) a lighter red wine, then the heavy weight of steak, equipped with Full Body weight body wine. When the dessert will be equipped with wine, Sauternes noble rot wines such as Bordeaux, is a good choice.![Alt Social differences between China and Obama\'s meeting with XI](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7720/27357357223_1ea054a68f.jpg)Chinese and Western social how entertaining the President learned muchWestern toasting differencesChinese people more seriously, is the order of the toast. Of wine table usually has two hosts and guests, to propose a toast to both identity and position for sequence: first Cup is the main house of worship leadership collective, sometimes the host jingzhubin, drink a toast to everyone again, this can be; guests do not toast, this can result in distracting feeling of not respecting his master\'s House. When jingzhubin later, higher guest the pleasure of guest, junior does not have to respect; then the Guest House back, finally, accompany to respect. Unless you are a leadership capacity, should not be one the pleasure to many people, but many people one person can.The toast is complete after the first lap, can leave their seats and others before toasting. Leading in worship with people around drunk, drank a toast in a clockwise circle; when the other person out of his seat, you should toast to family leadership, respect to others. For foreigners, and, after the start at the dinner, usually leave the seat, walk around to the others before toasting.Foreigner toast is very simple, in each dish when we picked up the glass and mutual respect, usually each touch, even touching just about mutual touch, touch also is no need to kill. Domestic touch means \"cheers\", if you and others into touch, then you must dry glass of wine if there is no clink, drink less can get free. If it is leading to toast with you, if the leader is a Cup, you should toast and cups less than leader; toast with your right hand-side up, to show respect, can be combined with the left hand pad the bottom of the Cup.Foreigner told details domestic relationsAlthough the drink is intended to talk about business, but in the domestic table, usually does not talk business details, but only the general direction is enough, complex to the Office to talk about, but foreigners he talks very carefully, will talk about details while drinking, or even a whole plan can be brought up for discussion. Chinese people drink the most important objective is to improve the relationship, the two sides had a good relationship with business would be good, but foreigners doing business depends on efficiency, legal and finance are more seriously.Chinese and Western social how entertaining the President learned much [Table 2015SIHH celebrities grams of rice and wheat](http://www.faybag.com/2016/06/16/table-2015sihh-celebrities-grams-of-rice-and-wheat-tribute-to-stars-of-tomorrow/)Dinner at home, if everyone is drinking if you don\'t drink, it will seem to have restraint, are difficult to talk about business success. So running business in the Mainland, even if you do not drink too much, to avoid starting it keeps saying \"I don\'t drink\", rather than after drinking a few cups of each toast \"lick lick\" drank a little, then smiled and said \"I have had enough\" people will also feel better. Foreigner\'s dinner, pour wine into your glass, drinks and do not drink is all about you, people won\'t you, no one will call you a drink, will not be affected.National Party ended when the House leadership will toast one last time, thank the guests for coming, then dry glass; others should follow a toast, don\'t let your glass empty. Foreigners at the end of dinner, toast will politely thank, but dry and not just random.Wine is about the rules, although there are no books will write these rules, but messing up Western table culture, would leave a bad impression. Especially the VIP meet for the first time, the wine may be your golden opportunity, business must be understood.Obama social networking foreigners, XI Jinping leadership dinner wines to drink Chateau
