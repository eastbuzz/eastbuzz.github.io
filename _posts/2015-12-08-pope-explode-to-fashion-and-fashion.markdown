Later, we gave it different names, in different cultures and different times and there are a variety of different features â€“ other side of Utopia, paradise, perfection, and so on.Heidegger says we are \"into\" the world. Because it is \"into\", they were thrown here we need to find meaning. Many people can\'t find the time, no despair, or rational meaning in the world outside the boundaries of a metaphysical, rather than the meaning of life and hope, given a high or out of reach of the other.Shelley brilliantly sums up in one sentence the gesture, it is this: life is elsewhere.Life is elsewhere, means refusing to accept being left meaningless reality and the real world, and the meaning and hope, and placed in a not in the daily \"trouble\" in place, this place is the future of afterlife fantasies, Kingdom of heaven, or is the realization of the Kingdom of God in this world.In ancient and modern relatively weak places, is the religion of the meaning and hope; if only Europe\'s development in modern times this is called revolution are from all eras and cultures through the ages love to find; this is called fashion of contemporary consumer society.

Religious expectations of is future of heaven; real of revolutionaries is never stop revolution of, because revolution of stop means with became Xia a round revolution of object; real of love believers is never stop attempts to of, because they forever impossible get so-called of perfect Yong live of love; and fashion, if left has kept of changes, a quarter quarter popular and behind, IN and OUT, on as fish left has water, free attraction.![Alt Pope explode to fashion and fashion](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/729/23228430979_4cb548a824.jpg)Linda EvangelistaSecondly, it needs is that he\'s absolutely worship and enthusiasm, and this became the source of passion. Religion and revolution, religion and love, revolution and love, the eternal power is a common passion, passionate people can put up with the hardships of reality, because there is always an absolute supremacy of his heart.

I see nothing change, nature does not change, just the way and arrived, along with the time or changes in the environment, as well as the personal orientation of the changes. With a simple linear, evolutionary history of looking at changes in the history of the human spirit, is not IN itself.![Alt Pope explode to fashion and fashion](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5817/23228448569_e3b10888ee_z.jpg)Linda EvangelistaIn addition to the latest group of religious blockbuster, what else is bothering Pope?
