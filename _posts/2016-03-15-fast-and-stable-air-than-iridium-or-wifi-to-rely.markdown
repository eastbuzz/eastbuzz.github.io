It is learnt that recently United Kingdom satellite company Inmarsat and Germany telecoms operator Deutsche Telekom received related to matchmaking, flights to 28 Member States of the European Union covering the LTE network and satellite networks. The plan successfully implemented, will benefit European passengers, the plane also has Wifi, so you can dry to resolve flight problems.

That are connected by multiple satellite and terrestrial LTE site, satellite signals by spectral form in the sky to cover every corner of the 28 Member States of the European Union, and a full range of coverage. In this way, as long as appropriate any part of the aircraft are within this range, you can use the Wifi.　　Such a look, seems vaguely familiar, like the former Iridium. So what exactly is the Iridium project? About science here. [Just Cavalli iPhone 6 cases](https://poshmark.com/listing/Tortoise-Shell-Sunglasses-56e5250db4188e84eb034c83)　　The scheme is run by the Motorola company in the 90 \'s of the last century\'s global system for mobile communications, namely through 7 tracks in the sky, each of the 11 satellites evenly distributed, global coverage. All mobile phones can be of Iridium system anywhere in the world directly connected to a satellite phone. Very convenient, because looks like a chemical element Iridium nuclei around the operation of 77 electrons, so called Iridium. The plan eventually failed, due to the high cost of the average person cannot afford. Per minute fees alone will reach $ 3-7, do not say at that time, the cost is now unthinkable.

However this plan failed, but creating a personal mobile satellite communications precedent. It is worth mentioning that, when Iridium and the EU airlines Wifi coverage plans to use satellites to be provided by the International Maritime Satellite Organization. Obviously, this plan is a certain shadow of Iridium. Only this time, because of advances in science and technology for more than 20 years. May not have again been year Iridium\'s \"Waterloo\".　　If this scheme is successful, it will for the future global mobile personal satellite communications technology to bring progress, perhaps in the near future, our cell phones can be directly connected to the satellite in the sky, and no longer limited by the signal. In that case, mother will no longer have to worry about finding you again.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology , The Internet[![Alt Just Cavalli iPhone 6 cases]([[3, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h09/img201509221034440.jpg\', \'Fast and stable air than Iridium or Wifi to rely\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1682/25769697026_508c30914d_z.jpg\'], [5, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h09/img201509221034441.jpg\', \'Fast and stable air than Iridium or Wifi to rely\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1687/25165292514_22e2bba702.jpg\'], [7, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h09/img201509221034442.jpg\', \'Fast and stable air than Iridium or Wifi to rely\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1498/25169173063_43675efd6a_z.jpg\']])](http://www.nodcase.com/just-cavalli-iphone-6-case-leopard-red-p-4109.html)If you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
